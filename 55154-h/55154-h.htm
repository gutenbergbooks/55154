The Twins and How They Entertained
the New Minister</strong></p>
<hr class="c10" />
<p class="center">Characters<br />
Bobby and Betty, the twins. Rev. J. Jones, the minister.</p>

<p class="center">Scene<br />
A reception room. Enter Betty and the minister.</p>
<hr class="c10" />

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> (With a grown-up air.) There! Sit right down, and I’ll
see if Mamma’s in. No, not that one, that’s only for show. The leg’s
broken, and it aint got fixed yet. Take the Morris chair. That’s the
one sister’s beaux always sit in. There, now you’re all comfy. I’ll
tell Mamma you’re here, if she’s in.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. Jones.</span> Tell her that I am making pastoral calls. I
am&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> Yes, I know who you are. “I’m the new minister,” you
was a going to say, wasn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> (Entering.) ’Twas my turn to answer the doorbell,
Betty Forrest. ’Taint fair! You just camp out in the hall to get ahead
of me! You got the book agent, and the Mission Lady, and now you’ve
got the minister. Course you’ll beat!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Beat?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> You can tell him, Bobby, while I go ask Mamma if she’s
in. Sometimes she’s in when she isn’t, and sometimes she isn’t when
she is, and the only way to be sure you won’t get a whipping for
telling it the wrong way, is to go ask her. She’s in her room, I know,
but maybe she isn’t in. You tell him ’bout the new game, Bobby. (She
runs out.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> It’s what we call the Caller’s game. Betty made it up.
Betty’s awful smart to think of new things. You see, Thursday
afternoon is Christine’s day out. Say, aint it funny to call an
afternoon a day? And Mamma don’t
<!--006.png-->
like to answer the bell herself,
’cause then she couldn’t be out if she didn’t want to see the one that
rung it, so she made me and Betty do it, ’n course we hated to be
bothered&mdash;you know callers are such a nuisance when you’re busy
playing, and Betty shirked and made me do it most all. So Daddy said
if she didn’t do her share, he’d bring home candy, and give it all to
me, ’n then Betty she made up this game. We’ve each got a little book,
and we put down which caller we answer the bell to and get a piece of
candy for each caller, and if there’s more candy than there is
callers, we get two pieces for each one, and now Betty likes to answer
it, and she gets the most candy every time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> (Returning.) That’s ’cause I’m smartest, Daddy says.
He says, “Trust a woman to get the best of a man every time, be they
ever so young.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> And what did Mamma say?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> She said, “Mercy me! The minister? I suppose I shall
have to go down, or your Father won’t like it.” What are ministers
made for?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> I think I must go. Tell your mother I was sorry
not to meet her.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> But you got to see her. She’ll be down soon as she
puts on her hair and squeezes her feet into her new tango slippers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Pa says it’s foolish to try to put a number two shoe
on a number four foot.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> (Rising.) I think I must go now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> If you do, she’ll spank me good, for letting you,
after she said she was in. She told me to entertain you nicely till
she came down.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> I’ll entertain him. Men like men. Do you play poker?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Why no, do you?
<!--007.png--></p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> No, I aint learned how yet, but I thought you might
teach me. This cunning little table is a card table, and the cards are
in this little drawer. (Takes them out.) And these pretty round things
are the chips.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> They look more like Tiddledy Winks. They use ’em
’stead of money, ’cause Mamma won’t let ’em play for money. That’s
gambling.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> They pay the money down town, next day. I know, ’cause
I was with Daddy when he did, and he gave me a quarter not to tell
Mamma. ’Sides, Mamma plays Bridge and that’s just as bad, Daddy says.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Would they like you to tell me this?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> P’raps not, but you won’t tell, will you? It’s right
to tell the minister bad things, ’cause he’ll forgive you if you pay
him something, and you can do it over again. That’s the way Christine
does. She’s a Catholic. Are you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev.</span> J. J. No indeed, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> (Who has gone out, re-enters with a bottle and glass.)
Have some wine? <a name="chg1" id="chg1"></a>Daddy always entertains this way. It’s a fine flavor.
I drank a bit from the bottom of a glass once, and ’twas awful good,
but Mamma was mad about it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Put it back, my boy. I never drink. Ministers
never do.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> My, how thirsty you must get! What do you do when
you’ve been eating salt fish?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> I don’t care for salt fish.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Neither do we, but we eat a lot of it when we’re
saving up for a party.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> Can you dance the tango?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> No, I don’t dance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> That’s too bad. Let me show you how. It’s just as
easy! Come on. (Tries to drag him up.)</p>

<p><!--008.png-->
<span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> No, I don’t care to dance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> I won’t call you awkward, really. You do it so, you
know, (illustrates) but dancing’s no fun alone, you know. You need a
girl to hug. If you learn with me you can do it with the big lady
girls, the ones that you like best, you know.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> He don’t dance with ’em, he plays tag.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Oh no, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Mamma said so. Daddy said that all the girls were
chasing you, and Mamma said she guessed that you could do your share
of the chasing, all right.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> I know what you like&mdash;fast horses, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Well, I have a horse, of course&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> Yes, a real spanker! And a narrow buggy to take the
girls to ride. Say, do you hold ’em in, when you go over the “thank
you marms” and take toll? Daddy said he bet you did. He always used
to. He calls it taking toll when he makes me pay him for candy with
kisses. I s’pose the girls would be afraid to say no to a minister,
but sometimes I say no to Daddy, just to tease him, and he calls me a
little flirt, and takes ’em just the same.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Indeed. How old are you, little girl?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> I’m eight, ’n so’s Bobby. We’re twins, but I’m the
smartest and the prettiest. Daddy says so. Mamma’s great for bargains,
when she’s shopping, ’n when she bought me, Bobby was throwed in. She
didn’t need a boy, at all, but ’twas a bargain, you know. She bought a
five dollar waist yesterday for four dollars and ninety-five cents.
Can you play the piano?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> No, can you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> I can play the scale, and “Tell Aunt Rhody,” and when
I’m as big as you, I shall play all the notes. You can’t do much, can
you? Is that why you’re a minister?
<!--009.png--></p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> No, it’s ’cause it’s an easy way to earn your living.
Daddy said so. Just stand up in a pulpit and scold the people when
they dassn’t talk back, and have some men pass round plates to get
money for you. They don’t dare not to ’cause folks is looking. Once
Daddy put in a five dollar gold piece by mistake, and he sweared about
it when he got home.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> Yes, and last Sunday I put in my chewing gum by
mistake and he spanked me ’cause I sweared about it when I got home.
He said “Darn!” was naughty for a girl to say. Why is it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Because&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> Oh, I didn’t ’spect you to tell me. I don’t like to be
preached at. Have you got any s’criptions with you?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> Prescriptions? I’m not a druggist, nor a
physician.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Sub ones, she means. Mamma don’t like ’em. She hates
begging ministers. She always signs, you know, ’cause she must, but
she can’t afford to give away a whole dollar, or even half a one,
’cause her clothes are awful ’spensive, and the dressmaker bothers her
awfully with bills. Oh, wouldn’t you like a cigar? (Takes a cigar case
from a stand and passes it.)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> No indeed. I never smoke, and I hope you never
will.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Oh yes I will. It’s lots nicer than chewing. Just you
try. Or are you ’fraid it will make you sick? It did me, when I tried
it, but I’m going to try a cigarette next time. Taint so strong.
P’raps you better.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> You better not. Maybe your Mamma wouldn’t like it.
Mamma spanked Bobby.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rev. J. J.</span> My dear boy, I sincerely hope&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> Mamma’s coming.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> We’ve entertained you good, haven’t we? We
<!--010.png-->
haven’t
told anything we ought to not, have we? ’Cause if we have, we’ll get
spanked and sent to bed, when you’re gone.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bobby.</span> If we have, don’t you tell. Be a good sport, and don’t
tattle. Here comes Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Betty.</span> And she’s got her new dress on. We’ve entertained him,
Mamma!</p>

<p class="smaller">This is a burlesque on the district school of 100 years ago. Ezekiel
Simpkins, the teacher, is the central character. His costume is a
tight Prince Albert coat, with brass buttons, or a worn and faded
“claw-hammer” coat; colored vest, cut low; stock collar, with large
black tie; trousers, “high-water,” with a patch of other color on one
knee; well-worn shoes. Bald gray wig and “side” whiskers. The costumes
of the pupils are in keeping with those of the teacher.</p>

<p class="smaller">The characters all read their lines from the book, so that there is
very little to be memorized and for this reason this work can be

<p class="smaller">There is no friend like an old friend and after all there are no songs

know and love. There is just enough libretto to the work to form a
continuous chain of thought throughout, and we know of no Cantata that
will afford such a pleasing entertainment at such a small expenditure
of labor. The book is well worth its price if only to secure this fine
collection of old home songs. Full of sentiment, humor and pathos and
decidedly new and fresh in construction. <i class="decoration">Price, 30 <abbr title="cents">cts.</abbr> per copy,

<p class="smaller"><span class="street">Libretto by H. MacDONALD BARR</span> <span class="city">Music by CARL F. PRICE</span></p>

<p class="smaller">The most interesting, mirth-provoking entertainment which we have been
privileged to see or hear in recent years.</p>

<p class="smaller">It goes right to your funny bone with a new kind of tickle.</p>

<p class="smaller">It provides a whole evening of the finest fun without for an instant
suggesting the vulgar or commonplace. There is a laugh in every line
of the libretto and a lilt to every brace of music which makes it
irresistible. The spell cannot be broken by the fall of the curtain
for the oft repeated strains of “Love is the way to spell Living” are
sure to echo and re-echo long after the entertainment is over.</p>

<p class="smaller">This entertainment is easily within the ability of the ordinary church
choir with augmented chorus. Special costumes are needed by only three
or four characters, the chorus being in ordinary dress. No elaborate
stage setting is necessary, a neat platform with an adjoining room, or
with a door, being the only requisites for its presentation. A piano
should be on the platform.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THE STORY</p>

<p class="smaller">Professor Herr Lover has written a cantata, the rehearsal of which he
is to conduct. He has proposed marriage to the leading soprano,
Ledgoline Topsee, but she is afraid he lacks the quality of patience,
and plans, with the aid of her friends who compose the cast, to
utilize the rehearsal to test him in that respect. After tolerating a
series of aggravating interruptions and delays on the part of the
singers, he at last gives away to a burst of angry passion, only to
discover what he has lost by so doing. By a clever surrender, however,
he turns defeat into victory, and the affair ends happily.</p>

<p class="smaller">This play given by your <em>Church Choir</em>, <em>Young People’s
Society</em> or <em>Ladies’ Aid</em> will prove a financial success
beyond your fondest dream. <em>Someone</em> will give this in your
vicinity. Why not be the first and reap the benefit for <em>your</em>
church or Society?</p>

<p class="smaller">The price is 75 cents per copy with a small license fee for privilege
of public performance for profit, but we have a special proposition to
offer for its first appearance in each city or town. If interested,
write for particulars with prospectus.</p>

Arabella Pinkham, who has come to “Mud Hollow” to assume the

possible.</p>

</div>

<p class="smaller">Two mysterious pieces of paper fall into the hands of the children,
one being found by the BOYS and one by the GIRLS. The meaning of the
inscription on each remains a mystery until it is discerned that by
placing the papers together they have the message that the “Old Witch”
of the North has captured “Santa” and holds him in an ice prison at
the North Pole. Of course there could be no “Merry Christmas” without
their “patron saint”, so guided by the “Fairy Godmother” they start
for the North Pole to rescue him. The “Old Witch” endeavors to block
the rescuers’ way by the assistance of “Old Zero” and the “Snow
Fairies” but when they learn that the snow drifts they are piling up
are to aid in keeping “Santa” from his usual Christmas activities they
get the “Sunbeam Fairies” to come to their aid and melt the snow,
while they bind with a frozen cord the “Old Witch,” who is found
indulging in a nap which she takes only once every hundred years. With
the “Old Witch” powerless and in their control the Rescue of Santa is
an easy matter.</p>

<p class="smaller">Tho’ belated somewhat by his enforced stay at the North Pole, the
children are glad to become his “aides” in spreading a “Merry
Christmas” through all the world. This is a very clever plot, well
worked out, and will make a decided hit for the Christmas season. 4
Boys and 5 Girls with any number of Fairies. Time about 1 hour. Price
25 cents.</p>

trying experience with Nora Flanagan, the new “hired girl,” who in

which Nora makes a date with Miss Courtney’s “intended” is ridiculous
in the extreme. 3 females. Time about 15 minutes. Price 10 cents.</p>

<p class="smaller"><strong>The Twins and How They Entertained the New Minister.</strong> They have
a delightful time telling family secrets to the “New Minister,” who

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>
